## Things to do:
1. come up with idea about the structure of all my future problem solutions
2. implement simple testing system, so i will able to create multiple main() functions and run them without needing to comment the code in other files
3. implement auto checking the tests, so i can put all test in $2$ .txt files (input and output) and this system will check my submission for correctness
